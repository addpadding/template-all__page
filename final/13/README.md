# netflix-carousel-css-only

The code from [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/b--q6Fsf_cA), where I did my best to clone the Netflix carousel UI using CSS only.

**This uses the `:has()` selector**. If you want to play with the code, make sure that [you're browser supports the `:has()` selector](https://caniuse.com/css-has).

Don't use anything like this in production until support is much better than when I used it (May 4th, 2022), where it was only supported in Safari and behind a flag in Chrome.
